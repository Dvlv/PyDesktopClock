# PyDesktopClock
Desktop clock widget for windows

## What?
Windows 10 removed the little clock widget. When I'm in a full screen game, I no longer can see the time.

I've written a little clock which can be put onto a secondary monitor and kept above everything so I can always see the time.

Press Ctrl + f to remove the window border to make it more discreet. Ctrl + f again puts it back so you can move/close it.
